## How does it work?

Unmock works by capturing HTTP calls in your code and injecting responses from mocked versions of services initialized at arbitrary states.

## Install

Any of the subpackages in this project can be installed via `npm` or `yarn`.

```sh
$ npm install --save unmock # all the packages
$ npm install --save unmock-<tool> # specific unmock tools (core, cli, expect, etc)
```
